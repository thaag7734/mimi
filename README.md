# MIMI
Musical Instrument Markup Interface

## What is MIMI?
MIMI is essentially a human-readable version of MIDI. It has a syntax similar to that of XML, which makes it very easy for humans to write music and understand music that has already been written just by using a text file - no notation software required!

## Why MIMI?
MIMI improves on the format of MIDI in a few ways.

- MIMI is designed to be human-readable, meaning that anybody can sit down and type a song in MIMI format with no need for external software.
- MIMI has support for different tunings, i.e. A432, A440, etc.
- When the [parser](https://github.com/thaag7734/mimipy) is complete, MIMI will be able to be condensed into MIDI, making it universally compatible.
